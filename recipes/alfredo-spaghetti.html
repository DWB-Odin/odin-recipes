        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This is an amazingly cheese-rich dish. I love making this to take to friends' homes as a drop off meal. 
        <br>It gets rave reviews every time! The recipe is adapted from a restaurant in the Mall of America called Tucci Benucch.
        <br>I attended the restaurant at a business meeting and they gave us a recipe for the baked spaghetti that I have made a few changes to.
        <br>My husband prefers it without the marinara/meatball topping, but if you're looking to stretch the recipe that's a great way to do it.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
            <li>1 pound shredded mozzarella and provolone cheese blend</li>
            <li>2 (16 ounce) jars Alfredo sauce (such as Ragu®)</li>
            <li>½ cup ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) jar marinara sauce, or to taste (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package frozen cooked meatballs, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until halfway cooked through, about 6 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Stir provolone cheese blend, 1 jar Alfredo sauce, drained spaghetti, ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, and eggs together in a bowl. Pour into prepared baking dish. Cover the dish with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until hot and bubbling, 60 to 75 minutes. Remove foil from baking dish and top spaghetti with remaining Alfredo sauce.</li>
            <li>Stir marinara sauce and meatballs together in a saucepan; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until meatballs are heated through, 15 to 25 minutes. Spoon meatballs and marinara over baked spaghetti.</li>
        </ol>
